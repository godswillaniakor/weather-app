# 🌦️ Weather Activity Ranking App

This is the **Weather Activity Ranking App**, a full-stack application that provides weather-based activity recommendations. The project is divided into two main parts:

1. **Backend**: Handles weather data fetching, activity scoring, and API endpoints.
2. **Frontend**: Provides a user interface for selecting a country and city, and displays activity recommendations.

Each part has its own `README.md` file with detailed documentation.
